# Murata SCHA63x driver for Arduino

Simple driver for the Murata SCHA63X series of IMUs for the Arduino board. The full data sheet for the sensor can be requested from [Murata](https://www.murata.com/en-global/products/sensor/gyro/overview/lineup/scha63t). SPI is used for communication between the sensor and the Arduino board. The carrier PCB documentation is available [here](https://www.murata.com/-/media/webrenewal/products/sensor/pdf/specification/scha600_series_chip-carrier_pcb_specification.ashx?la=en-gb&cvid=20210302030225000000).
